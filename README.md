🕴️ Why did I built it?
 
 - The project that led me to become a developer. StudioHut was first built on a no-code platform
   of which I was having trouble integration payment systems, changing the style and even removing 
   simple images that i didnt want displayed. 
   
   After the surging costs of the no-code platform I decided to close the account and build the application on a wordpress-directory theme.
   Trying to fit the theme for my needs it became a total chaos which led me to learn simple web development.
   
   After learning basic HTML & CSS I decided to push forward and learn JavaScript of which was a wonderful decision. 
   Now I am on my way to become a professional web developer starting from the front-end.
   
   Altough the StudioHut Platform is halted due to constantly re-writing codes after learning a better way to do it, 
   I am fully dedicated to finish the platform and publish the site with a user-frienly, pixel perfect front-end and a safe & scalable back-end (probably 
   going to use firebase as my back-end starting point, but i am not sure just yet🤔).
